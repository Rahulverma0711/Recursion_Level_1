Thank you so much for the congratulations and the kind words!

It was a great experience to participate in the Maximizing Personal Effectiveness (MPE) training. It has been a rewarding experience, and I’m excited to apply the skills and insights gained in my current role and beyond. The emphasis on discipline and foundational habits has been particularly valuable, and I am committed to incorporating these principles into my daily routine.

I’m also deeply honored by the special recognition from the NS leadership team. Congratulations to Neeraja, Rahul D, Mrunal, and Vinit—your achievements are truly inspiring!

A big thank you to Debanita and the LLS team for their support and guidance throughout the program, and to the NS leaders for their valuable time and engagement with us.
